# Memory Game
Memory game is a game where the user has to discover 8 different images. When he clicks on a box he can display the image hidden under it, to uncover the image permanently he has to click on the box that hides the identical image.
The images won't change from place unless the game is started again. Only 2 images can be shown at the same time. When the user has discovered all images the game is finished.
The best time that the user has ever played and the best number of moves that the user has needed in his games are stored in the cache and displayed on the screen.

## Installation
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/MewoArgenta/MemoryGame`
2. Open the html file with your favorite browser
3. enjoy!

## Usage
The game is made for the screen of an iPhone 5, I made this decision because it is one of the smaller screens currently used.
When the game is opened on a wider screen it will work perfectly, the content will be centered in the middle, which is easy because your cursor won't have to move a lot to discover all the images :-).
